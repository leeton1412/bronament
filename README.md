# Bro-nament a site for Gaming Tournaments

![Responsive screen grab of homepage](assets/images/responsive-bronament.png)

A website built to help friends combine their competitive nature and friendships *Bro-nament*. 
The website will contain a javaScript based tournament system that can be used as a extra resourse when friends gather together.

## Ease of use

Most current tournament based sites require registration and a fee. This site will build a bracket based on the amount of players and progress them on button click.
There is no need for any registration or fees as it is all client-side based. 

### Supported Brackets

The site currently supports:
* 2 players
* 4 players
* 8 players

Onclick events will trigger the amount of brackets to generate. Players will then enter their names into the brackets.

If the individual wins their match, clicking the icon next to their name will progress them through the brackets.

It can be used on all devices.

## UX

#### Goals

The aim of this website is to provide a quick, easy to use, and intuative system so friends can quickly build and play tournaments between each other

#### Users

The predicted users of the site will be Friendship Groups, Tournament Organisers, Gaming Websites and Small Event Organisers.

### User Stories 
1. A group of friends looking to compete against each other in a tournament environment.
2. Tournament Organisers looking to create a more simplictic approach.
3. Tournament Organisers looking for a cheaper approach for smaller events.
4. Gaming websites looking to create articles on Esports.
5. A Small event Organiser looking to find a quick solution to a Esports competitive tournament setting.
6. Fans of Esports who wish to create their own brackets and predict player movement.

## Thoughts Behind The Design

The website colors and fonts are designed to give the page a dark intense feel. Having competed in Esports, the feeling of an intense atmosphere is something I can relate to.
I believe that this sort of feeling is important to give the site a competitive feeling.

### Colors and theme of the website.

* Revolver:   ![#333238](https://via.placeholder.com/15/333238/333238)
* Manatee:   ![#94929b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/94929b/94929b)
* Black: ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000)
* Cloudy: ![#aba599](https://via.placeholder.com/15/413f3f/413f3f)

### Font Choices 
Header font throughout the website are chosen to mimic a Retro Gaming feel:

    *font-family: 'Monoton', cursive; 

Elements such as paragraphs are a complementing font and Bootstrap recommended:

    *font-family: 'Segoe UI', 'Source Sans Pro', 'Calibri', 'Candara', 'Arial', 'sans-serif';;
